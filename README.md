# B-tree implementation in JavaScript and partially in C++
- I originally wrote this in JavaScript while learning to programatically implement a B-tree after learning it through articles and videos as well as practicing them through flow chart graphs.
- I also started writing it in C++ where I implemented an insert and has function.
- I was going to use them for indexing in my database project, but realised I do not need B-trees, but do need B+ trees which are easier to implement.
- Nethertheless, it was a fun experience learning B-trees and optimising it and hope the code I wrote serves a purpose one day.
